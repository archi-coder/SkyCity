Welcome to Sky City!

The code returns the x,y,z coordinates of all given objects for the purpose of simulating Sky City.
Sky City was visualized with Rhino and Grasshopper and needs to be installed to run the code. Check the McNeel website for the installation files.
To understand what the Sky City is visit https://filipromaniuk.com/sky-city

To run the code:
1. Open the Rhino file 007 - TEMPLATE for Sky City.3dm
2. Run Grasshopper
3. Open the 006 - SKY CITY - FR - Clean.gh file
4. In the "Folder Path"  window fill the path of the downloaded "3Dmove input" folder with CSV files
5. Wait until the main code component will finish the computation
6. Now you can display the results with the displayer. Set the Timer object to a small amount of time like 10 ms and enjoy the simulation.
7. The computed 3d coordinates can be saved into a CSV file.

I have added thy py file which contains the main part of the code so you can have a look at what the program exactly is doing without opening grasshopper.

Enjoy!
